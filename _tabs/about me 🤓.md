Hello! I'm a passionate and driven engineer with a diverse background in **automotive technology** 🚗, **mechatronics** 🤖, and **mechanical engineering** ⚙️. I began my career as a **car mechatronic technician** and **car wrapper**, which provided me with a solid foundation in hands-on problem-solving and a deep understanding of vehicle systems. Over time, my passion for engineering evolved, and I transitioned into **mechanical engineering** 🔧.

This platform is my long-term documentation project 📚, designed with the goal of expanding my knowledge and skills over the next 5-10 years. The first stage of this journey is dedicated to mastering **Electrical Engineering** ⚡, followed by an exploration of **Control Algorithms** with their **Physics** and **Mathematics** 🔬. As I progress, I will dive into **Software Development** 💻, **Robotics** 🤖 (with a focus on areas like **Sensor Fusion** 🧠, **Thrust Vector Control** 🛠️, and **Reaction Wheels** 🎡), and much more.

Through this project, I aim not only to enhance my own capabilities but also to create a resource that can maybe help others along their engineering projects 🚀. My ultimate goal is to become a much better version of myself, capable of tackling complex problems across various fields of engineering 💡.
