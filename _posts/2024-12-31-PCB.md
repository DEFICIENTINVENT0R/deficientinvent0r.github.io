## **Introduction**

### _**Purpose of the PCB**_

This PCB is designed as a **primary development platform** to explore a variety of exciting fields, including:  
- **Model rockets**  
- **Flight computers** for fixed-wing aircraft or multicopters  
- **Robotic control systems**

It serves as a **general-purpose computer** with **CAN bus capability**, allowing it to function as the central brain for specialized, task-focused PCBs.

---

### _**Background**_

The development of this PCB is the result of approximately **three months of intensive learning**, during which I studied:  
- **PCB design principles**  
- **Datasheets of components**  
- Insights from forums such as [r/PrintedCircuitBoards](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoards) and [r/AskElectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics)

Key references include:  
- The **Hades flight computer** by Phil’s Lab 
- Peripheral designs from **Reddit**, **Adafruit**, and **SparkFun**

This journey has been a mix of research, experimentation, and building a deeper understanding of electronics.

---

### _**Components and Software**_

The components were selected based on their compatibility with existing libraries for popular development platforms like:  
- **PlatformIO (PIO)**  
- **ESP-IDF**  
- **Arduino**

This approach enables rapid prototyping while providing a pathway to learn **bare-metal programming** by studying and adapting these libraries.

---

### _**Future Iterations**_

As a self-taught enthusiast and not a trained electrical engineer, this design represents the best I could achieve with my current knowledge. Future iterations will focus on:  
- **Addressing hardware limitations**  
- **Refining the design** as I gain more experience  
- Implementing improvements based on real-world testing and feedback

This iterative process is key to evolving the PCB into a more robust and versatile platform.

---

## **Design Choice**

### _**Power Management**_

This PCB is designed to be powered by a **LiPo battery** in combination with a **switching regulator** capable of delivering **5V @ 9 Amps max**. This should provide sufficient power to operate at least three servos with a stall current of **2.5–3 Amps** each.  

#### _Power Distribution_
- **Servos**: The exact number of supported servos will be determined after real-world measurements.  
- **ESCs**: These will connect via the servo connectors but will use their own dedicated **LiPo battery**.  

In later development stages, I plan to design a **slave PCB** connected via **CAN bus** to control the servos’ BLDC motors, which will include decoders.

#### _Switching Regulator_
The **switching regulator circuit** is the most complex part of this schematic for me. To simplify the process, I used a **1:1 copy of Phil’s Lab Hades flight computer** as a reference.

#### _Voltage Regulation and Monitoring_
- **LDO (Low-Dropout Regulator)**: Provides **3.3V** logic levels for the MCU and sensors.  
- **INA219 Current Sensor**: Included for real-time current monitoring and power management.

Power management is a critical aspect of this PCB, and I anticipate making adjustments as testing progresses to ensure reliability under load.

---

### _**USB Interface**_

The **USB interface** is largely based on a **1:1 copy of the dev board schematics**, with a few modifications to suit this PCB’s needs:

#### _Key Modifications_
- **USB-C Ports**: Replaced the original Micro USB ports with **USB-C** for improved durability and versatility.  
- **TX/RX Transmission LEDs**: Added to the **USB-UART converter** for better visibility of data transfer activity.  
- **Auto Programmer Logic**: Retained for development purposes, simplifying the programming process.  
- **ESD Risk Reduction**: Designed with precautions to minimize **electrostatic discharge (ESD)** risks during handling.  

---

### _**Flight Computer Controller Unit (FCCU)**_

The **Flight Computer Controller Unit (FCCU)** acts as the central brain of the system, running the primary algorithms and managing key functionalities.

#### _Features_

- **SD Card**: Functions as a read/write **eMMC** for:  
  - **Data logging**  
  - Saving **calibration data** to avoid writing to the ESP's internal EEPROM.  

- **Current Sensor**: Monitors the **battery state** to ensure reliable power management.

- **CAN Bus**: Serves as an **extension slot** for task-specific slave PCBs, providing flexibility for future expansion.

- **Buzzer**: Used for feedback, such as:  
  - Battery state alerts  
  - Specific system states  
  - Error notifications  
  - Location indication (e.g., if the system lands somewhere unexpected).

- **Status LEDs**: Indicate key statuses, including:  
  - Calibration progress  
  - Communication activity  

- **Servo Headers**:  
  - **3x10-pin 2.54mm (0.1") servo headers**  capable of **5V @ 9 Amps max** for:  
    - **Six servos**  
    - **Four BLDCs** with external ESCs & LiPos.  

- **I2C Molex Connector**: Additional **board-to-wire** connection for peripherals or other components not yet specified.

The FCCU is designed to handle a wide variety of tasks while being modular and expandable, ensuring adaptability for future use cases.

### _**Navigation Controller Unit (NAVCU)**_

The **Navigation Controller Unit (NAVCU)** acts as the dedicated brain for navigation tasks, handling computation-heavy **sensor fusion** and managing a wide array of peripheral sensors. It communicates with the **FCCU** via **UART** and **I2C** and is optimized for navigation-specific operations.

#### _Features_

- **SD Card**:  
  - Functions as a **read/write eMMC** for:  
    - **Detailed data logging** during development stages for analytics and error handling.  
    - Storing **calibration data**, avoiding writes to the ESP’s internal EEPROM.  
  - Unlike the FCCU, the NAVCU focuses on logging detailed sensor data, while the FCCU logs only mission-critical information for transmission to the ground station.

- **CAL_BTN**:  
  - A **calibration button** for manual sensor calibration when needed.

- **SPI Molex Connector**:  
  - Includes an **extra board-to-wire connection** for SPI.  
  - Can also function as **four GPIO pins** due to the pin multiplexing capabilities of the **ESP32S3**.

- **GNSS Module**:  
  - **NEO-M9N** with a dedicated board-to-wire Molex connector for configuration via an external USB-to-TTL adapter.

- **IMUs**:  
  - **BNO055 (9DoF)**: Primary IMU for accurate sensor fusion.  
  - **BMI088 (6DoF)**: Redundant secondary IMU for backup.

- **Magnetometer**:  
  - **IIS2MDCTR (3DoF)**: Complementary to the **BMI088**, enhancing accuracy in navigation tasks.

- **Temperature Sensor**:  
  - **TMP100**: Monitors board temperature to identify and address potential heat absorption issues.

- **Barometer**:  
  - **DPS310**: Barometric pressure sensor for precise altitude measurements.

The NAVCU is specifically designed to offload navigation tasks from the FCCU, enabling efficient and precise control over flight dynamics while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

### _**Uncertainties**_

There are four key areas where I have some uncertainties regarding the current PCB design:

#### _1. Schottky Diodes_ 
- **Placement**: I’ve placed a total of six Schottky diodes, one for each power source:  
  - **4x USB**  
  - **1x Switching Regulator**  
  - **1x Hot-Start GNSS External Battery Connector**  
- **Concern**: Are these placements correct, and have I missed any necessary Schottky diodes?

#### _2. ESD Protection_ 
- **Current Placement**:  
  - **2x ESD diodes** on each SD card slot.  
  - **4x ESD arrays** for each USB slot.  
  - **1x ESD diode** on the GNSS SMA antenna.  
  - **1x ESD diode** on the CAN bus Molex connector.  
- **Missing ESD Protection**:   
  - **I²C external connector**  
  - **External SPI Molex connector**  
  - **Boot, reset, and calibration buttons**  
  - **Safeboot header** for the GNSS module  
  - **Molex connector** of the GNSS module  
  - **Hot-start battery connector** for the GNSS module  

#### _3. Test Points_  
- **Concern**: While I believe the current test points are sufficient, I am still uncertain and would appreciate feedback.

#### _4. F.Mask for the BMI088_  
- **Issue**: There’s uncertainty about the F.Mask configuration for the **BMI088** and whether it good or bad for manufacturing.

These uncertainties highlight areas where I may need further review or guidance to ensure the design is robust and functional.

## **Reports**

> * The warnings from the electrical rule checker are known and occur due to the INA219 Current Sensor, its current sense resistor, and the schematic of the switching regulator. Schematic snippets are attached for inspection.  
* The ignored test "Footprint component type doesn't match footprint pads" in the DRC is due to the USB connectors, as they are both SMD and THT.
